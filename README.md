- Cleaned and merged FIFA Datasets (10,000 observations and 4 features) using Python and JupyterNotebook.
- Created data visualizations that would aid in the statistical analysis and determination of optimal variables to input into the KNN-algorithm using Pandas and NumPy.
- Optimized KNN-algorithm by testing different K values in order to obtain the most accurate predictions possible using Sci-Kit Learn.
- Compared predicted values with true values and determined which players were being underpaid or overpaid.

- Developed and fine-tuned a k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) regression model to predict the durations of power outages based on influential factors like cause, geography, and population metrics, using a dataset that included detailed information on past power outage events.
- Conducted rigorous data cleaning and exploratory data analysis to identify key predictors, manage outliers, and ensure data quality, which included encoding categorical variables and selecting relevant quantitative features for model training.
- Evaluated the model's performance using root mean square error (RMSE) and R-squared metrics, performed a fairness analysis comparing predictions across different U.S. regions, and refined the model by incorporating features like peak energy consumption hours and population metrics to improve prediction accuracy.

- Cleaned and merged Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) datasets from 2016 to 2021 (15,000 observations and 4 features) using Python and JupyterNotebook.
- Created line plots that would portray trends of NO2 over time and performed statistical analysis including linear regression on these datasets using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Statsmodel.

### [Does Colder Weather Lead to Longer Power Outages?](https://github.com/hgallocodes/Cold-Weather-and-Power-Outages)

<img alt="Tools | Python" width="22px" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/python/python-plain.svg" /> <img alt="Tools | Pandas" width="22px" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/pandas/pandas-original.svg" /> <img alt="Tools | Numpy" width="22px" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/numpy/numpy-original.svg" /> 
- Analyzed a comprehensive dataset of major power outages in the U.S. from January 2000 to July 2016 to identify the correlation between weather conditions and power outage durations, focusing specifically on the impact of colder weather on the length of outages.
- Conducted extensive data cleaning and exploratory data analysis to refine the dataset for relevant variables, implemented hypothesis testing to examine the relationship between power outage durations and cold weather, and communicated findings through clear insights.
- Utilized statistical methods and permutation tests to validate the hypothesis that colder weather leads to longer power outage durations, contributing to the development of strategies for improving infrastructure resilience and emergency response during adverse weather conditions.

- Developed an interactive globe, using JavaScript and D3, that allows the user to hover over countries and reveal its COVID-19 cases, GDP, and population.
- Automated the visualization to spin at a constant rate and programmed it to give the user the ability to zoom in and out of countries as well as pan from one side to the other.
